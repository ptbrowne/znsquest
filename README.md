Code to make an awesome board game

In cards, you'll find code to generate cards for a board game.

General idea:

- Have a SVG template representing a card
- Generate SVG cards from data inside a text file
- Put those SVGs into a HTML page to do further treatment on them (font-size tweaking)
- Screenshot the webpage with the `:screenshot` command from Firefox

See the `generate.js` and `card-v3.svg` files for more information.
